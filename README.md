- Used Playwright to scrape important stats and box scores from the last two NBA seasons straight from the web
- Parsed over 2,000 HTML files using Beautiful Soup, grabbing everything from game links to specific stat tags
- Took all the raw data and used Pandas to build clean, organized Data Frames with just the stats that mattered
- Once each box score was turned into a usable format, I merged everything into one big CSV for modeling
- Ran a Ridge Regression model to predict NBA game outcomes based on historical stats and team performance
- Focused on figuring out which columns actually helped the model and dropped the ones that didnâ€™t move the needle
- Started with a prediction accuracy of 52.6%, then improved it to 64.8% by adding rolling averages and opponent context
- Built logic to predict live games by plugging in the latest stats and simulating matchups between teams
- Overall, combined data engineering, feature selection, and time-aware modelling to build a practical NBA game predictor
